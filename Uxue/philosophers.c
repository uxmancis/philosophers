/*DESCRITION
*	philosophers project aims us to learn about threads, a fundamental 
*	concept in programming concurrency.
*
*	Threads in programming refer to the smallest unit of execution
*	within a process. They are independent paths of execution
*	that can run concurrently (at the same time) within a single process. 
*	Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process 
*	they belong to, enabling them to communicate and share data efficiently.
*
*	philosophers program makes x philosophers (threads) carry out their
*	daily routine (eat, sleep, think). The philosophers (threads) share
*	forks for eating. Which means a philosopher (thread) must wait for another
*	philosopher (thread) to finish eating so that the fork is free in order
*	to start eating.
*	
*	Mutex will have to be used to avoid data races. Race conditioons are
*	intra-process (threads level, sharing same memory), not inter-processes.
*
*	Deadlocks happen when all threads are locked to proceed their execution,
*	as all of them are waiting for the other thread to free the shared
*	resource (as they share memory).
